# CalculatorREXX

##Here are the rules of how to use the program
All calculations are done in an infix manner.
For example:
```
3 - 5
```
NOT:
```
- 3 5 OR 3 5 -
```

Enter in your arguments with a space in between.
For example: "3 + 5", not "3+5".

##Functionality
You are able to add, subtract, multiply, divide and use exponents.

add: +
subtract: -
multiply: *
divide: /
exponent: E

The calculator will take higher precedence for exponents over multiplication and division, and higher precedence for multiplication and division over addition and subtraction.
